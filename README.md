# finnish-interest-calculator
Asks for the amount of money, divides it by 100, multiplies it by the user inputted interest rate, prints it, repeats this 3 times, then divides all 3 results by 12 to get the month's interest, adds them together and prints the result. Very simple, made for my grandfather to automate his interest calculations at his request.
